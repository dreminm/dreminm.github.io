# For companies

We are the part of the Computer Graphics and Multimedia Laboratory, situated in the Moscow State University, Russia. We are:  
* \#1 university in Russia, by THE, QS and ARWU rankings
* \#1 computer graphics and multimedia laboratory in Russia
* In the top of the world university laboratories for the research applicability and video compression:
  * \#1 [codecs comparison](/codecs/)
  * \#1 [video-matting benchmark](https://videomatting.com/#rating)
  * \#1 [video quality measurement tool](/vqmt/)
  * \#1 by the number of [implemented stereo metrics](/stereo_quality/)

The case is that the governmental financial support is considerable low, in compare to other countries. Hence we have the only way to survive - to be extremely practical.

Here is a list of companies we collaborated with:
