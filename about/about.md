# About Us

The Graphics & Media Lab Video Group is part of the Computer Science Department of Lomonosov Moscow State University. The Graphics Group began at the end of the 1980s, and the Graphics & Media Lab was officially founded in 1998. The main research avenues of the lab include areas of computer graphics, computer vision and media processing (audio, image, and video). A number of patents have been acquired based on the lab’s research, and other results have been presented in various publications. The main research avenues of the Graphics & Media Lab Video Group are video processing, video quality analysis, and video compression (codecs testing and tuning, quality metrics research, and codecs development).

## Achievements
### #1 video codecs analysis
The companies send us the codecs, and we find out, which one is better.

Here is a list of companies we collaborated with:

{% include companies_list.html %}

Our stats by 2019:
* 210 analysed video-codecs
* 22  published comparisons reports
* 500 thousand downloads of reports

Some of our [reports](/codecs/) are publically available.

### #1 video quality estimation tool
We have [VQMT](/vqmt/) for monoscopic and [VQMT3D](/stereo_quality/) for stereoscopic video. We can predict in advance whether you will have a headache after watching the 3D movie. The tools have more quality assessment metrics than any concurrent ones declared. Take a look at our assessment reports on the projects' pages. Our stats by 2019:

* 22 monoscopic video quality metrics
* 13 stereoscopic video quality metrics
* 150 estimated feature-length stereoscopic movies
* 9 reports on stereoscopic movies estimation

### #1 video matting benchmark
The [VideoMatting](https://videomatting.com/) project is the first public objective benchmark for video-matting methods. Our work ranks existing methods and aids developers of new methods in improving their results. Previous cases of estimation:
* Comparison of video matting methods #1
    * 13 competitors
    * 30 test-cases
    * 543 participants
* Comparison of video matting methods #2
    * 14 competitors
    * 30 test-cases
    * 434 participants

### #1 subjective quality estimation
The [Subjectify](http://subjectify.us) project provides a crowd-sourced algorithms evaluation platform. It is designed for the subjective comparison of images, video, and sound processing methods. Previous cases of estimation:
* Comparison of video completion methods
    * 6 competitors
    * 7 test-cases
    * 341 participant
* Comparison of saliency-aware encoder
    * 2 competitors
    * 31 test-case
    * 98 participants
* “\-\-tune ssim” comparison
    * 4 competitors (× 3 bitrates)
    * 4 test-cases
    * 219 participants
* Video codec comparison
    * 7 competitors (× 3 bitrates)
    * 4 test-cases
    * 325 participants (11530 answers)
* Netflix study replication
    * 6-10 competitors (for various test-cases)
    * 7 test-cases
    * 375 participants

### Other
* We make algorithms to correct and improve videos. Our [filters](/video_filters/) have 3 million downloads by 2019.
* The [EVT](/codecs/) project increases the video's quality and decreases the file size, by providing the optimal parameters for any codec. Yours too.
* The [Compression](http://compression.ru/index_en.htm) project is the biggest resource on video compression.
* We have developed the exclusive tools for Intel, Samsung, Huawei, RealNetworks, and other companies, adapting our algorithms for specific video streams, applications and hardware like TV-sets, graphics cards, etc.
