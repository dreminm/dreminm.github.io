</div>

Easy subjective video testing organization for companies and universities

* Projects, ideas: Dr. Dmitriy Vatolin  
* Implementation: Oleg Petrov, Georgy Osipov

How to make subjective video quality comparison with MSU PVQT:

1.  

    Collect materials for the test

    We support more than 300 video formats and all main image formats

    See [Recommendations on
    materials](/vqmt/pvqt.html#materials).

2.  

    Choose method and create test with PVQT Editor

    Now we support DSIS, DSCQS I and II, SCACJ, SAMVIQ from ITU-R BT.500
    and EBU

    See [Methods'
    brief](/vqmt/pvqt.html#methods).

3.  

    Invite observers and organize tests with PVQT Player

    Observers can pass test in local network, in specially prepared room
    or individually. ITU-R BT.500 recommends at least 15 observers to
    complete the test. If you need observers to test your videos,
    please, [mail us](mailto:video-measure@compression.ru)

    See [Test organization
    variants](/vqmt/pvqt.html#organization).

4.  

    Collect and process results

    You see results in real-time in most cases. Statistical estimates as
    well as Bradley-Terry model results for pairwise comparison are
    available in PVQT

    See [Result inspection section in
    documentation](http://compression.ru/video/quality_measure/src/MSU_PVQT_Documentation.pdf).

PVQT 2.0 FREE licenses for BETA testing: [Get

## How to use PVQT

</div>

### What is PVQT?

PVQT is a tool, developed by MSU Graphics & Media Lab.
Video Group for evaluating of subjective quality (with reference or
without one) of a video and image files.

The tool was developed according to ITU-R BT.500
“Methodology for the subjective assessment of the quality of television
pictures”. The program does not exactly repeat the standard, as it is
focused on the measurement of quality for television, but PVQT is aimed
for quality measure of digital materials. Also, it has some additional
features not described in the standard.

### PVQT structure

PVQT consists of 2 basic parts:

-   Editor (MSU PVQT) — for creating a test and
    collecting results (see section *Creating a test* in
    [Documentation](http://compression.ru/video/quality_measure/src/MSU_PVQT_Documentation.pdf)),
-   Player (MSU PVQT Player) — for performing
    (playing) test by observer or operator in case of Network test (see
    section *Passing a test* in
    [Documentation](http://compression.ru/video/quality_measure/src/MSU_PVQT_Documentation.pdf)).

<span id="materials"></span>

### Materials selection

To create PVQT test you need one or more groups of source files. The
source files can be videos or images: PVQT supports all basic video and
image formats. Each group consists of different versions of one picture,
which will be compared with another picture of that group. Group can
have a reference. In that case all pictures will be compared to the
reference. Without reference there can be pairwise comparison with SCACJ
method.

ITU-R BT.500 recommends videos to be at most 10 s length. In case of
images, you can tune duration that the image displays. Whole test should
be no longer 30 m including voting, training questions and period
between videos. You can have several sessions with breaks, each for 30
minutes. See ITU-R BT.500 for details.

## Methods' brief

- **DSIS — Double Stimulus Impairment Scale**

    Videos are shown consequently in pairs: first video is the reference
    (observer is informed about it), second video is an impaired.

<div class="center">
<embed src="/assets/img/vqmt/pvqt-info/DSIS.png">
</div>

- **DSCQS I — Double Stimulus Continuous Quality Scale Type I**

    In one playback window observer is free to switch
    between two videos. One of videos is the reference one, but an observer
    is not informed about it.

<div class="center">
<embed src="/assets/img/vqmt/pvqt-info/DSCQS-I.png">
</div>

- **DSCQS II — Double Stimulus Continuous Quality Scale Type II**

    Videos are played simultaneously (side-by-side) a
    given amount of times (repetitions), one is the reference one, but an
    observer is not informed about it.

<div class="center">
<embed src="/assets/img/vqmt/pvqt-info/DSCQS-II.png">
</div>

- **SCACJ — Quality evaluation using categorical scale**

    Two videos are shown simultaneously, after playback observer is asked
    about his opinion.

    You do not need to have references for this test. Pairwise results will
    be processed according to Bradley-Terry model.

</div>
<div class="center">
<embed src="/assets/img/vqmt/pvqt-info/SCACJ-2.png">
</div>

- **SAMVIQ — Subjective Assessment Method for
Video Quality evaluation**

    Observer is able to play any sequence
    from the test set and give it mark, plus observer is able to play
    reference video.

## Organization of testing

- **Single computer testing**

    All observers
    pass a test on the same computer. No additional preparations are needed.
    It can be the computer on which test was created, or project correctly
    transmitted to another computer. We recommend install PVQT player (or
    full PVQT) to that computer and run test from Windows Explorer.

<div class="center">
<embed src="/assets/img/vqmt/pvqt-info/pass-queue.svg">
</div>

- **Testing via shared folder**

    In this method, the test can be run by an arbitrary number of observers
    simultaneously or not on computers on the same local network, for
    example, in a computer class. The test manager can view the results in
    real time.

    Edit and save project to location available to another computers via
    shared folder. You should use “Relative paths” and all videos should be
    also available via same shared folder or be referred in project by
    network path.

    Multiple observers can pass test simultaneously (for example, in
    computer class). If Editor for this project file is opened you can see
    progress and results of each observer in Real-time. Also, it will
    display overall progress in summary.

<div class="center">
<embed src="/assets/img/vqmt/pvqt-info/pass-lan.svg">
</div>

- **Testing with distributed observers**

    In this method, you are sending test and videos to observers, located
    anywhere, who will pass the test at any time. After test is complete,
    observers will send you back results of testing.

    To use this method, specify email in field “Result collecting e-mail”.
    After test is finished, observer will be asked to send a special archive
    (\*.pvqtres) file to that email.

    After you collect some archives from observers, you can import them into
    PVQT using “Import results from \*.pvqtres file” command (project should
    be saved). You can import multiple files at once.

<div class="center">
<embed src="/assets/img/vqmt/pvqt-info/pass-distributed.svg">
</div>

- **Testing using mass view**

    This method will be implemented in the next version of PVQT.

    You choose to show the video on a large screen, for example, through a
    projector that is viewed by several observers. Each of them votes on
    their device.
