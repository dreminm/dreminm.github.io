  <p>Content diversity in test sequences is necessary for running algorithms in near-realistic conditions. To provide this diversity the following steps have been undertaken.</p>
  <p>The taxonomic video categories from Vimeo and Youtube were combined and 50 of the most popular videos with different lengths were downloaded from each category. This ensures unbiased video selection and sufficient cover in terms of semantics and context presented in the video. All the videos were viewed by a person for compliance with its category to ensure good result quality taken in the first step. Then, SI/Ti features and video bitrate were counted for each video and for each class videos with different SI/TI and bitrate were chosen to ensure diversity in terms of spatial and temporal information presented in the video and initial source video quality.</p>
