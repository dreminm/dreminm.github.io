  <p>Content diversity in test sequences is necessary for running algorithms in near-realistic conditions. To provide this diversity the following steps have been undertaken.</p>
  <p>We identified two families of cases: processes during which temporary distortions could occur, i. e. montage, streaming, capturing from different rigidly-connected cameras (different framerate) etc., and content in test videos which is difficult to align, i. e. talking head, recurring events (such as football matches, formula-1 racing), camera on a tripod (small amount of movement) etc. Then, we downloaded ~7000 videos from vimeo from each taxonomic category to ensure unbiased video selection and sufficient cover in terms of semantics and context presented in the video. Finally, SI/Ti features were counted for each video and for each class we mapped videos to use cases mentioned above. We chose videos that sufficiently cover SI/TI space and all the identified use cases.</p>
